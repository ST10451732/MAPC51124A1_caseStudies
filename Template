Best practices and principles for assignments in the context of **Mathematical Principles for Computer Science (MAPC5112)**. 
Here are some guidelines for completing your assignment:

1. **Academic Honesty**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the assignment rules provided in the registration contract.
   - Ensure that your work is your own and not copied from other students.
   - Avoid uploading the assessment question to any external websites or apps.
   - Do not download your assessment response from any website.
   - If you use AI tools, review, re-write, and re-work the information, and always reference them in your work.

2. **Assignment Format**:
   - Your assignment must be typed unless otherwise specified.
   - All work should be adequately and correctly referenced.
   - No material may be copied from original sources unless it's a direct quote indicated with quotation marks.
   - Limit direct quotes to no more than 10% of the assignment.

3. **Submission**:
   - Submit your assignment through SafeAssign.
   - Save a copy of your assignment before submitting it.

4. **Individual Work**:
   - This is an individual assignment; collaborate only with yourself.
   - Do not share your assessment with other students.

Remember to complete the **Academic Honesty Declaration** provided. 
By adhering to these principles, you'll ensure the integrity of your work and receive fair assessment. Good luck! üòä
